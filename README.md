To use: "perl tweet.pl". In order to tweet on a regular interval use cron, I may implement regular re-tweeting somewhere down the line.

To configure:

Set lines 38 - 41 of tweet.pl to your consumer key, consumer secret, token, and token secret provided for your twitter account from the twitter API located at https://dev.twitter.com and https://dev.twitter.com/apps.

More information about the keys and tokens can be found at https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/oauth
